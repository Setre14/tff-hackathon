## How to contribute

The Build project is under the MIT license. We accept contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions related to development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Read the install for build and test instructions
- Play with the project, open issues, submit patches!

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).
- Make your changes and arrange them in readable commits.
- Make sure your commit messages are clear about what changed and why.
- Make sure all tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
- Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
